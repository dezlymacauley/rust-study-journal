// NOTE: Writing Tests
// You run your tests with the command `cargo test`

/* Step 1: Create a new library project

Whenever we make a new library project with Cargo,
a test module with a test function in it is automatically generated for us.
This module gives you a template for writing your tests,
so you donâ€™t have to look up the exact structure and syntax every time,
you start a new project. You can add as many additional test functions,
and as many test modules as you want!
