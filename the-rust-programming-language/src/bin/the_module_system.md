Rust has a number of features,
that allow you to manage your codeâ€™s organization, 
including which details are exposed, which details are private, 
and what names are in each scope in your programs.

These features, sometimes collectively referred to as the module system,
include:

   - Packages: A Cargo feature that lets you build, test, and share crates
   - Crates: A tree of modules that produces a library or executable
   - Modules and use: Let you control the organization, scope, and privacy of paths
   - Paths: A way of naming an item, such as a struct, function, or module

To create a new project:

`cargo new name-of-your-project`

Cargo follows a convention that src/main.rs, 
is the crate root of a binary crate with the same name as the package. 

Likewise, Cargo knows that if the package directory contains src/lib.rs,
the package contains a library crate with the same name as the package,
and src/lib.rs is its crate root.

Cargo passes the crate root files to rustc to build the library or binary.

If a package contains src/main.rs and src/lib.rs,
it has two crates: a binary and a library,
both with the same name as the package.

VERY IMPORTANT:
A package can have multiple binary crates,
by placing files in the src/bin directory: each file will be a separate binary crate.

To run a specific file 
`cargo run --bin the-name-of-the-file-excluding-the-rs-part`
E.g. `cargo run --bin 6_functions`
