// NOTE: Data Types

// Rust is a statically typed language, 
// which means that it must know the types of all variables at compile time. 
// The compiler can usually infer what type we want to use based on the value, 
// and how we use it.

// NOTE: Scalar Types

// Rust has four primary scalar types: 
// integers, 
// floating-point numbers, 
// Booleans, 
// and characters.


// NOTE: Integer Types
// An integer is a number without a fractional component
// In other words a whole number

// i means that it is a signed integer. 
// The number can be positive or negative.

// u means unsigned integer
// The value cannot have a a sign. 
// I.e. The value can only be positive

NOTE: Unsigned Integer sizes (For storing positive numbers)

+--------+---------+-------------------------------+
| Length | Unsigned| Range of Numbers (Inclusive)  |
+--------+---------+-------------------------------+
|  8-bit |    u8   |            0 to 255           |
| 16-bit |   u16   |           0 to 65,535          |

// NOTE: How are these calculated

Each signed variant can store numbers from -(2n - 1) to 2n - 1 - 1 inclusive,
where n is the number of bits that variant uses.

So an i8 can store numbers from -(27) to 27 - 1, which equals -128 to 127. 
Unsigned variants can store numbers from 0 to 2n - 1,
so a u8 can store numbers from 0 to 28 - 1, which equals 0 to 255.

Additionally, the isize and usize types depend on the architecture of the computer your program is running on, which is denoted in the table as ‚Äúarch‚Äù: 64 bits if you‚Äôre on a 64-bit architecture and 32 bits if you‚Äôre on a 32-bit architecture.

// NOTE: How to know which integer size to choose?
// integer types default to i32 and u32
// The primary situation in which you‚Äôd use isize or usize,
// is when indexing some sort of collection.
